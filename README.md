# Overview
It takes a village to do structured journalism. Coordinating among so many disparate activities is a serious barrier. We believe that, if done right, smart automation tools can help. This team will attempt to use intelligent automation to coordinate developer activity, content production, and content presentation into a working structured journalism ecosystem.

# Key Team Skills
Collectively, the team must have the following skill:
1. Finite-state machines
1. Flask
1. Node Red
1. JavaScript
1. JSON
1. MongoDB
1. Docker
1. Azure

# Roles and Responsibilities
1. **(3) Community simulation developers**-- Use Flask to create finite-state machine simulations of content developers, expert communities, and fact checkers. Publish APIs for the simulations. Read from and write to the MongoDB content repository.
1. **(1) MongoDB repository and content developer**-- Create a content repository in MongoDB. Populate it with JSON data that the community simulators need to run their simulations.
1. **(1) Node-Red flow developer**-- Use Node-Red to coordinate across the community simulations.
1. **(1) Node-Red dashboard developer**-- Use Node-Red to create a dashboard that provides a summary of what is happening in the Node-Red flows.
1. **(1) Platform engineer**-- Package Node-Red and community simulations into a Docker container. Publish and run the container in Azure.
